##Object Space Tracking
utilising animal pose estimation pipelines, DeepLabCut and SimBA, to track grooming behaviour in rats in an open-field object space task and detect possible memory consolidation of long-term abstracted memory after spatial learning; I analyse videographed behaviour and electrophysiology data acquired by other members of the lab. I am continuing previous work on synchronisation and behaviour tracking. In the future, I plan to compare the temporal resolutions of different task-related behaviour in association with memory.
